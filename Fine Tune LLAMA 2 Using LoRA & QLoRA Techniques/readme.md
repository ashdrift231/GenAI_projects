**Fine-tuning Llama 2 with QLoRA
This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune the Llama 2 7B chat model on a custom dataset using the QLoRA technique.

**Libraries and Tech Stack

The following libraries are used in this notebook:

accelerate: For distributed training and mixed precision.
peft: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning library, used for implementing LoRA.
bitsandbytes: For 4-bit quantization, enabling training on limited hardware.
transformers: Hugging Face's library for accessing pre-trained models and tokenizers.
trl: Transformer Reinforcement Learning library, used for the SFTTrainer for supervised fine-tuning.
torch: PyTorch deep learning framework.
datasets: Hugging Face's library for loading and processing datasets.
Dataset and Fine-tuning
The notebook uses the mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k dataset, which is a reformatted version of the timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco dataset following the Llama 2 chat template.

The fine-tuning is performed using QLoRA, a technique that reduces memory usage by quantizing the model to 4 bits and using LoRA for efficient fine-tuning. This allows training large models like Llama 2 on consumer-grade GPUs.

Results and Learnings
The fine-tuned model, named Llama-2-7b-chat-finetune, is saved and pushed to the Hugging Face Hub. The training process and results can be monitored using TensorBoard.
